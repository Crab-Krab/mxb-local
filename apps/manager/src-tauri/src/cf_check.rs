//! Cloudflare's managed check, for the hidden WebViews that fetch from behind it.
//!
//! [`crate::mxb_fetch`] (mxb-mods.com) and [`crate::shop_fetch`] (mxbikes-shop.com) each park a
//! hidden window on a site that serves Cloudflare's managed challenge. Most of the time the
//! check clears by itself in the hidden window. Sometimes it wants a click, and a hidden window
//! cannot be clicked: it waits out its timeout and the request fails, every time.
//!
//! So the window waits [`REVEAL_AFTER`] for the check to clear by itself, then shows itself to
//! the user, sized and titled for it, and hides again once the check is past. The check is
//! always the user's to complete: nothing here answers it. Closing the window, or leaving it
//! for [`ASSIST_TIMEOUT`], ends the attempt and latches until the site's module re-arms it with
//! [`Site::reset`], so a refusal can never turn into a window that keeps reopening.
//!
//! Everything here is per [`Site`]: its window, its domain, what the main window is told, and
//! what error a request gets once the session has stopped asking.
